## Game Features

* **Crowded Board:** All 32 pieces are placed on a 4x8 grid with no empty squares at the start.
* **Fog of War:** All pieces begin face-down. You don't know which pieces are where!
* **Flip or Move:** On your turn, you can either flip a hidden piece or move one of your revealed pieces.
* **Unique Endgame:** The game only ends when the final (32nd) piece is flipped. The winner is decided by scoring the pieces left on the board.
* **Custom Piece Rules:** Several pieces have been improved with new movement rules!

## Custom Piece Movements

This variant uses custom rules for several key pieces to make the game more dynamic:

* **General (將/帥):** Moves and captures one square in all 8 directions, like a standard Chess King.
* **Advisor (士):** Can move to an empty square in any of the 8 directions, but can only capture diagonally.
* **Elephant (象):** Moves and captures any number of squares diagonally, like a standard Chess Bishop.
* **Horse (馬):** Jumps in an 'L' shape and cannot be blocked, like a standard Chess Knight.
* **Cannon (炮):** Can use **any** piece (flipped or hidden) as a "platform" to jump over for a capture.

## How To Play

1.  **Start:** Player 1 flips any hidden piece.
2.  **Assign Colors:** The color of the revealed piece goes to Player 2. Player 1 gets the opposite color.
3.  **Take Turns:** Players take turns either flipping a new piece or moving one of their own.
4.  **Win:** The game ends when the last piece is flipped. The player with the highest score wins!

Enjoy the game!
